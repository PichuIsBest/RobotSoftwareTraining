# Getting a C2 in Robot Software
## Downloading the repository and setting up your branch
* Make sure you have git installed on your computer
* Create a new folder on your computer with nothing in it for robot code (if you have already done this skip this step).
* Open that folder on VS Code.
* Find the terminal at the bottom of Vs Code (if this is hidden you can show it under View and Terminal).
* Into the terminal enter `git clone https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/RobotSoftwareTraining` (this will download the repository onto your computer).
* Into the terminal enter `cd RobotSoftwareTraining` (this will move you to the RobotSoftwareTraining folder in the terminal).
* Into the terminal enter `git checkout c2Template` (this will switch to the c2Template branch).
* Into the terminal enter `git checkout -b *your first name*c2` (this will create a new branch called `*your first name*c2` and then switch to it).
